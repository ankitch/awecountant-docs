# Managing Items

Products that can be sold or purchased, expense heads, and assets are treated as items. Users can select if inventory tracking is to be done for items.

## Item Category

Items inherit properties like tax scheme, default unit, type (trackable, fixed asset, direct expense, indirect expense) from category. Creating categories saves a lot of time while creating new items.
